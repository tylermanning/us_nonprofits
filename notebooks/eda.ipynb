    "- The data is dumped on a yearly basis, so you can see interesting YoY changes to revenue by a certain nonprofit or a certain sector of nonprofits. This could allow someone to see larger trends over time or regime changes. Though 8 years of data (2012-2019) might not be long enough to detect anything meaningful using standard time series techniques (ARIMA models). Might be only able to see extreme YoY changes. (e.g. when the ice bucket challenge generated a ton of money for ALS). Outliers like this might be easier to spot, especially given so many have no revenue.\n",

    "- There are a lot of columns/features for each EIN in this dataset, I would try some dimensionalty reduction techniques like PCA to determine what loadings are contributing most to the revenue or expenses. For example, are there variables that contribute towards a C-suite employees to be paid more? What factors dictate this.\n",
    "- Another avenue of investigation could be comparing similar nonprofits to each along certain dimensions and see where some are lacking. For example, if I am operating a nonprofit operating in animal sector, it would be good to know how my revenue or expenses compare to similar nonprofits (similar in # of employees or donations received). This way I can determine where I am lacking and make some adjustments."
